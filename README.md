# Hi there!

I'm Aidan, and I'm currently a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. 

I'm planning to graduate in Summer 2025. 
My current projects include working on clustering massive graphs/networks and helping maintain the [Biostrings](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Biostrings) R package.
I occasionally write blog posts about the things I've been up to lately, which you can check out below!

For more information, check out [my website](https://ahl27.com).
